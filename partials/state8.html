	<h2 class="midz"><b>Value Calculator</b></h2>

<p class="ten">If you feel confident that your product is unique enough to charge outside the discounted rate range, one may want to explore using value-based pricing. Basically, it is saying if my customers are willing to pay a higher price for my unique service then I'm going to charge it. This provides valuable insight into your customer's decision making process.</p>
<p class="ten"> To do this, three different things have to be taken into account:</p>
<ol class="typea">
	<li class="real">What is the unit price of the second best option for the customer among your competitors?</li>
	<li class="real"> In a dollar amount (per unit), what is the value of all the ways that your product is superior to the second best option? This could be the dollar value of various features your product offers that your competitor does not.</li>
	<li class="real">In a dollar amount (per unit), what is the value of all the ways that the second best option is superior to yours?</li>
</ol>
<p class="ten">In the end, this certainly does not always give you the final "right" answer, but it does get you close! This lets you see how your customers are making decisions, and creates a calculated price so you can see if it makes sense.</p>
<p> Simply enter the numbers (with or without decimals) without symbols ($15.43 would simply be entered as 15.43) into the appropriate input box and click on Calculate or hit enter.</P>
