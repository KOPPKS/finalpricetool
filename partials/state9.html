	<h2 style="text-align: center"><b>Break-even Point</b></h2>

<p style="font-size 10">Break-even price is the price a company must sell its product at given a particular volume of production. Calculating the break-even price helps the company determine the price it will need to charge for its products. It also helps the company plan its future production. To calculate break-even price, the company needs to know three things:</p>
<ul style="font-size 10">
	<li class="real">The total fixed costs to produce a desired number of units. Fixed costs would include rent and employee salaries (or employees who are paid on a fixed salary). It's important to note that this does not imply fixed costs per unit, but rather a total cost for a specified level of production. For example, if it costs $5,000 to produce 1,000 units, the fixed cost would be $5,000.</li>
	<li class="real">The desired level of production. In the previous example we proposed that it would cost $5,000 to produce 1,000 units. In this instance 1,000 units would represent the desired level of production.</li>
	<li class="real">The last variable is variable cost PER UNIT. Unlike the previous two variables, which represent over all totals, this last variable is a cost per unit. Variable cost per unit includes things like hourly employee wages and utiities, which unlike rent and fixed salaries can fluctuate in value.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size 10">Fixed costs are ones that do not change with the level of production. However, variable costs do change with the level of production.</p>
<p> Simply enter the numbers (with or without decimals) without symbols ($9.15 would simply be entered as 9.15) into the appropriate input box and click on Calculate or hit enter.</P>
