	<p class="fourteen">Competitive pricing is one of the most widely used strategies used by major businesses. Vendors use a competitive pricing strategy when several other businesses sell the same product and there is little to distinguish one vendor from another. A market leader will generally set the price for the product and other vendors will usually have no option but to follow suit in order to remain competitive. Vendors will either match the pricing of the market leader or set prices within a comparable range.</p>
